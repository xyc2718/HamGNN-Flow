# Trimmed-down `pytorch_geometric`

MACE uses [`pytorch_geometric`](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) [1, 2] framework. However as only use a very limited subset of that library: the most basic graph data structures.

We follow the same approach to NequIP (https://github.com/mir-group/nequip/tree/main/nequip) and copy their code here.

To avoid adding a large number of unnecessary second-degree dependencies, and to simplify installation, we include and modify here the small subset of `torch_geometric` that is necessary for our code.

We are grateful to the developers of PyTorch Geometric for their ongoing and very useful work on graph learning with PyTorch.
